# Chorus

Simple Chorus with a animated display to visualise the parameters:

* Rate - The frequency of the LFO which modulates the delay lines.
* Depth - The amplitude of the LFO which modules the delay lines.
* Feedback - Increasing the feedback will emphasise the chorus effect.
* Dry-Wet - Controls how much of the original signal is mixed with the processed signal.
