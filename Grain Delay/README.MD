# Grain Delay

Granular Delay Plugin with fixed frequency/size ratio.

* Base Delay - Controls the length of time until the processed signal is played back
* Frequency - Controls how many grains are emitted per second. Increasing the frequency will reduce the size of each grain.
* Width - Pushes the wet signal into the stereo field.
* Dry-Wet - Controls how much of the original signal is mixed with the processed signal.
